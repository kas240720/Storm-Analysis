# Storm-Analysis



Introduction


We will be analyzing data regarding storms and associated fatalities in the US in 2000. This data falls in line with patterns of climate change and geography. We want to explore if there are significant discrepancies between the fatalities of different storms or locations and try to figure out why that is. By doing so, we can better understand the climate patterns as they’re changing based on location, and whether future storms will pose a greater threat in those areas. We can also investigate whether there exists a pattern in the times of year or times of day that the types of storms take place, which would give us insight into how to better prepare for future events.

This data about storms in the US is provided by the National Weather service, accessed through https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ncdc-storm-events-database. The entire set of data files tracks storms and injuries from 1950’s to the current year. It also includes what kinds of storms occurred, such as hail, blizzards, heavy storms, etc. On the following link, you can access the exact files we want to use: https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/. We are using the ‘Details’ and ‘Fatalities’ files from 2000. Here are the exact files:
StormEvents_details-ftp_v1.0_d2000_c20190920.csv.gz (renamed to StormEvents_details_2000.csv)
StormEvents_fatalities-ftp_v1.0_d2000_c20190920.csv.gz (renamed StormEvents_fatalities_2000.csv)

https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/Storm-Data-Export-Format.pdf gives us all the variables included as well as an in-depth description of each of them.
